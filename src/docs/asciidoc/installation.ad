To add the GORM Logical Delete plugin to an application add the following dependency to the dependencies block of your build.gradle:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
compile "org.grails.plugins:gorm-logical-delete:{version}"

Snapshots are now published automatically to Artifactory OSS on every successful build. You can use them by defining this
Maven repository inside the repositories block in your `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
maven { url "https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local" }
