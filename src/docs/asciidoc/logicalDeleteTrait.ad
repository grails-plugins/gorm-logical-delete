The plugin provides the link:api/gorm/logical/delete/LogicalDelete.html[gorm.logical.delete.LogicalDelete]
trait which can applied to a domain class to indicate that the domain class should
participate in logical deletes.  The trait adds a boolean persistent property named `deleted` to the domain class.
When this property has a value of `true`, that indicates that the record has been logically deleted and as such
will be excluded from query results by default.
