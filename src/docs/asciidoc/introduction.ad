The GORM Logical Delete plugin provides support for utilizing logical deletes for GORM managed entities in a Grails 3 app.

A "logical" delete (sometimes referred to as a "soft" delete) is a delete that doesn't actually delete the relevant
data but instead marks the data as deleted.  Marking the data as deleted as the benefit of excluding the data from
queries by default while still maintaining the ability to retrieve the data when/if necessary.
